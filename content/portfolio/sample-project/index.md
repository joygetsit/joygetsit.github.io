Our overall objective is on design and implementation of a Tactile Cyber-Physical System for real-time interaction between physical and virtual worlds for applications requiring ultra-reliable low latency communications.

Time-sensitive networking (TSN) is the IEEE 802.1Q defined standard technology to provide deterministic messaging on standard Ethernet. It provides guarantees of delivery and minimized jitter using time scheduling for those real-time applications that require determinism. We study Netronome smartNICs and NetFPGA network accelerators to implement 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS) to obtain bounded (determinstic) latency and reliability reagrding queueing and processing latency of the network devices on the path of a packet.
